# FiraCodeStyle Nerd Font

FiraCode Nerd Font patched with stylistic sets enabled (except ss06 and onum/ss20) for terminal emulators and applications that don't support stylistic sets.

The `FlTlfl-fix.otf` file is supposed to be a workaround temporary fix until a stylistic set is added to the official FiraCode. The fix disables the traditional ligatures which caused [code readability issues.](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/issues/902)
